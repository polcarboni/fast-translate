30k+ words file from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words

*Best to use from english for other languages.*

The file has many uncommon words estracted form a standard one that translated in other lamguages result in the same word.

Different instances of the same word in the source language are disambiguated using the most common one in the target language (more than one or all could be provided).

*Requires disambiguation and suffix checking.*

TODO:
+ Add *phonetic* to dictionary with `epitran`
+ Add search and addition of new words. (Try to translate the input word with separated thread, maybe with dedicated argument)
